# Taco Tracker
Taco tracker is a single page web application that list the top 20 breakfast
taco restaurants as returned by Google in the Austin, TX area. Users can
interactively search for and filter the listed restaurants, as well as get more
information on particular restaurants by selecting them from either the
available list or on the map itself. Selecting a restaurant opens an information
window with typical information such as address, phone number and hours supplied
by Google. But in addition, also includes information supplied by Four Square's
APIs such as the number of likes a restaurant has received, the photos users
have taken and even some useful tips about how to get the most out of your
experience there.

## Getting Started
Getting started using Taco Tracker is as easy as opening up the `index.html` file in your browser once you've cloned a copy of the repo. Now depending on your device this will display a list of taco restaurants to left and a Google Maps view to the right, if you are on desktop or tablet. Or if you are on a mobile phone in portrait view, a full screen Google Maps view of the restaurants with an option to show the list of restaurants at the bottom.

With Taco Tracker now open, you can simply select any one of the markers on the map to view more information about the restaurant such as the phone number, address, hours of operation and even helpful tips submitted by Four Square users.  Alternatively, you can also select one of the restaurants options from the list view to see the same information.

The search bar visible in the top left corner of the screen allows you to interactively search the set of restaurants, filtering both what's available in the list as well as the markers you will see on the map. Now selecting that one taco joint you're really interested in is as simple as selecting the only choice you see.
